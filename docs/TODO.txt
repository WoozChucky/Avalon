This is our TODO list:

-> Create a HighScore system
	- Should save the scores to a file ?

-> Add a Save/Load game system.
	- First should i even have that, since it's a very simple game ?

-> Add a nice royalty free background music.

-> Add a Random Level Generator

-> Finish the EntityGenerator for the remaining game entities.

-> Rethink about the enemy spawn system.

-> Add a very simple enemy entity AI (move, shoot back? , dodge player shots)

-> Refractor hardcoded UI elements position based on game resolution.
	- Missing GameState
	- Collision/Movement
