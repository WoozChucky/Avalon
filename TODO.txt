This is our TODO list:

-> Add a Settings system for Video and Audio configuration.
	- Maybe a file that is read @ startup. That file will contain the settings to be used by the app.
	- ie: width: 1920
	- How will that be handled when the user decides to insert some strange values in that file ?

-> Create a HighScore system
	- Should save the scores to a file ?

-> Add a Save/Load game system.
	- First should i even have that, since it's a very simple game ?

-> Add Shoot/Collision sfx sounds.

-> Add a nice roaylty free background music.

-> Add a Random Level Generator

-> Finish the EntityGenerator for the remaining game entities.

-> Rethink about the enemy spawn system.

-> Add a very simple enemy entity AI (move, shoot back? , dodge player shots)

-> Refractor hardcoded UI elements position based on game resolution.
